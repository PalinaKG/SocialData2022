Next, we want to investigate if number of pollutants are lowering or rising for each year. We will investigate each pollutant seperately using the average over all the boroughs to get the big picture for the entire city. We have seperate data for winter, summer, and annual values for some of the pollutants. Therefore, we are also going to see if there is a difference in number of pollutants between seasons. 



{{< include-html "content/homepage/bokeh_plots/Pollutants.html" "Looking through the plots we can see that pollution due to PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and O3 has been reducing considerably. We can also see that the amount is consideribly higher in the winter then the summer for most instances, which is quite interesting. We are clearly improving our quality of air a lot but we still have a long way to go! ">}}
