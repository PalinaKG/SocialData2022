We now know of the serious problems we face due to air pollution in the world. But why look at New York City specifically? 

It turns out that New York City has the highest increase in average temperature from the year 1900 to 2013 when compared to all the other cities that were considered (*Copenhagen, Helsinki, Melbourne, and San Francisco*). The overall land temperature increase during that time was around 1.4&deg;C which equates to around 0.013&deg;C per year.
