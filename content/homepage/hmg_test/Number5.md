{{< include-html "content/homepage/bokeh_plots/Predictions.html" "Finally we wanted to see if we could create a model to predict the future amount of pollutants for the years 2019-2028. When plotting the original data with the predicted data we can very well see that the data points are following a very slow logarithmic trend for each pollutant. Looking at these final plots reassures me that we are on the right track and by continuing on this track we can hopefully all breath healty air in the near future." >}}
